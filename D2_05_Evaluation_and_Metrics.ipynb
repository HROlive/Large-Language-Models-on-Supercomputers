    "Measuring performance on a text generation task is not as easy as with standard classification tasks such as sentiment analysis or named entity recognition. Take the example of translation; given a sentence like “I love dogs!” in English and translating it to Spanish there can be multiple valid possibilities, like “¡Me encantan los perros!” or “¡Me gustan los perros!” Simply checking for an exact match to a reference translation is not optimal; even humans would fare badly on such a metric because we all write text slightly differently from each other (and even from ourselves, depending on the time of the day or year!). Fortunately, there are alternatives.\n",

    "### BLEU\n",
    "BLEU is a widely used metric, especially for machine translation. The idea of BLEU is to compare words or n-grams. It's is a precision-based metric, which means that when we compare the two texts we count the number of words in the generation that occur in the reference and divide it by the length of the generation. Because the precision score favours short generations, we need to compensate for that with the brevity penalty. One of the limitations of this metric is that it doesn’t take synonyms into account.  \n",
    "This is the formula of the BLEU score:\n",
    "$$\\text{BLEU-N} = BR \\times \\left( \\prod_{n=1}^{N} p_n \\right)^{\\frac{1}{N}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The `bleu_metric` object is an instance of the `Metric` class, and works like an aggregator: you can add single instances with `add()` or whole batches via `add_batch()`. Once you have added all the samples you need to evaluate, you then call `compute()` and the metric is calculated. This returns a dictionary with several values, such as the precision for each n-gram, the length penalty, as well as the final BLEU score. Let’s look at an example:"
