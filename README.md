## Description

During the last three years, interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) has experienced a meteoric rise, leaving virtually no domain untouched. The complexity of the models themselves, however, has increased to such an extent, that access to powerful computing resources has become a requirement for anyone wanting to develop products with this novel approach.

In this intensive two half-day course, participants will dive into the world of LLMs and their development on supercomputers. From covering the fundamentals to hands-on implementations, this course offers a comprehensive exploration of LLMs, including cutting-edge techniques and tools such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), quantization, zero redundancy optimizers (ZeRO), fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP), DeepSpeed, and Huggingface accelerate.

By the end of this course, participants will have gained the understanding, knowledge and practical skills to develop LLMs effectively on supercomputers, empowering them to tackle challenging natural language processing tasks across various domains.

This course is jointly organized by the VSC Research Center, TU Wien, and EuroCC Austria.
